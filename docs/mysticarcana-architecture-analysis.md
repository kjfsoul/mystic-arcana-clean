# MysticArcana/MysticOracleV2 Architecture Analysis

## Application Architecture Overview

### 1. Frontend Architecture

The MysticArcana application uses a modern React frontend architecture with the following technologies:

#### Core Frontend Technologies
- **React** with **TypeScript** for strong typing and component structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, complemented by custom styling for the mystical theme
- **Framer Motion** for animations, particularly in tarot card components
- **Tanstack Query** (React Query) for data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Radix UI** for accessible UI primitives
- **Wouter** for routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)

#### Key Frontend Components
- **Tarot Card Components**
  - `AnimatedTarotCard.tsx` - Card display with animations
  - `daily-card-improved.tsx` - Daily tarot card feature
  - `tarot-deck.tsx` - Deck management and card selection
  - Various spread components (zodiac-spread.tsx, tarot-spread.tsx)

#### State Management
- **React Query** for server state
- **React Context** for global app state
- **Local component state** for UI interactions
- **localStorage** for user preferences (e.g., selected tarot deck)

#### Application Flow (Frontend)
1. User lands on the main page and sees the daily tarot card
2. Authentication via Supabase Auth (login/signup)
3. Users can access various tarot reading features:
   - Daily Card
   - Tarot Spreads (3-card, zodiac, etc.)
   - Personalized readings
   - Premium features (for subscribers)

### 2. Backend Architecture

The backend is a hybrid architecture in transition:

#### Backend Technologies
- **Netlify Functions** (serverless) - Being migrated from Express
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for database and authentication
- **OpenAI API** integration for generating interpretations
- **Stripe** for subscription/payment processing

#### Key Backend Services
- **Authentication** via Supabase Auth
- **Data Storage** in Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Tarot Card APIs** (daily card, readings, spreads)
- **Astrology APIs** (birth charts, horoscopes)
- **Payment Processing** via Stripe
- **AI-Generated Content** via OpenAI

#### Serverless Functions
- `daily-tarot.js` - Generates daily tarot cards
- Various other functions for readings, user data, etc.

### 3. Data Flow Architecture

#### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth
2. JWT token stored and used for authenticated requests
3. Roles determine access to premium/free features

#### Tarot Reading Flow
1. Frontend requests cards via React Query
2. Serverless function fetches/generates card data from Supabase
3. OpenAI generates interpretations (for premium features)
4. Data returned to frontend and cached
5. User interactions recorded in Supabase

#### Subscription Flow
1. User selects premium plan
2. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
3. Successful payment updates user role in Supabase
4. User gains access to premium features

### 4. Deployment Architecture
- **Frontend** - Deployed on Netlify
- **Backend** - Netlify Functions (serverless)
- **Database** - Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Additional Services** - OpenAI, Stripe
- **Authentication** - Supabase Auth

### 5. Integration Architecture
- **Autonomous Agent System** - CrewAI for automated tasks
- **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol for enhanced functionality
- **Environment Variables** - Managed via .env (locally) and Netlify dashboard

## Critical Pain Points and Technical Debt

### 1. Daily Tarot Card Feature (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: The daily tarot deck does not properly connect to the Rider-Waite deck.
- **Root Causes**:
  - Environment variable issues with Supabase connection in Netlify Functions
  - Incorrect image path resolution in `tarot-utils.ts`
  - Discrepancy between frontend card object structure and Supabase data
  - Missing error handling in daily-tarot.js Netlify function

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: Inconsistent environment variable handling across local and Netlify environments.
- **Problems**:
  - Supabase URLs and keys accessed inconsistently (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` vs `SUPABASE_URL`)
  - Service role key missing in Netlify environment
  - Environment variables not properly configured for serverless functions

### 3. Authentication Flow Challenges
- **Issue**: Authentication flow not properly integrated with premium features.
- **Problems**:
  - Access control inconsistently implemented
  - User roles not properly checked for premium content
  - Missing error handling for unauthenticated requests

### 4. Technical Debt in Component Architecture
- **Issue**: Multiple versions of similar components with inconsistent implementations.
- **Examples**:
  - Three versions of daily card components (daily-card.tsx, daily-card-local.tsx, daily-card-improved.tsx)
  - Duplicate logic across components
  - Inconsistent prop interfaces

### 5. Incomplete Migration to Serverless
- **Issue**: Partial migration from Express server to Netlify Functions.
- **Problems**:
  - Some endpoints still expect Express server
  - Inconsistent API patterns
  - Potential race conditions in data fetching

### 6. UI/UX Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Visual inconsistencies and mobile experience issues.
- **Problems**:
  - Inconsistent styling
  - Accessibility issues
  - Mobile layout breakpoints need adjustment

## Areas Needing Immediate Attention for MVP

### 1. Fixing the Daily Tarot Card Feature
- **Priority**: Critical - This is the central feature of the application.
- **Required Actions**:
  - Fix environment variable handling in Netlify Functions
  - Standardize Supabase connection approach
  - Correct image path resolution in tarot-utils.ts
  - Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
  - Verify API contract between frontend and backend

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Priority**: Critical - Required for all services to function properly.
- **Required Actions**:
  - Audit all environment variable usage
  - Standardize naming convention (VITE_ prefix for frontend, regular for backend)
  - Configure Netlify environment properly
  - Create proper documentation for environment setup

### 3. Authentication and Premium Features
- **Priority**: High - Core to the business model.
- **Required Actions**:
  - Fix authentication flow

## Technical Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables and Configuration
- Standardize all Supabase references to use consistent variable names
- For Netlify Functions:
  ```javascript
  // Change from:
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
  
  // To:
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
  ```
- Ensure all required environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard

### 2. Daily Tarot Card Fix
- Implement proper error handling in `animated-tarot-card.tsx`
- Fix image path resolution in `tarot-utils.ts`
- Ensure consistent data structure between frontend and Supabase
- Add skeleton loading and error states

### 3. Component Architecture Cleanup
- Consolidate the three daily card components into a single, robust implementation
- Standardize prop interfaces across similar components
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for all data structures

### 4. API Consistency
- Standardize all API endpoints to follow RESTful conventions
- Complete migration to Netlify Functions for all backend services
- Implement proper error handling and status codes

### 5. Testing and Validation

## Conclusion

The MysticArcana application has a solid foundation with modern technologies and a clear vision. The main issues are concentrated around environment configuration, API consistency, and component architecture. By addressing these issues systematically, the MVP can be successfully delivered with the core tarot reading experience intact.

The highest priority is fixing the daily tarot card feature, which is currently broken due to environment variable and image path resolution issues. Once this is fixed, the application will provide the basic functionality required for the MVP launch.
