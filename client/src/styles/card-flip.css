/*
  Most of the flip animation is handled by Framer Motion in AnimatedTarotCard.tsx using rotateY.
  This file can be used for:
  - More complex static state styling for the card faces if needed.
  - Custom keyframe animations if you choose to use CSS animations for some effects
    instead of or in addition to Framer Motion.
  - Fine-tuning the 3D appearance.
*/

/* Example: Adding a subtle depth or border effect that's tricky with utilities */
/* This is optional, Framer Motion handles the core flip */

/* .tarot-card-face { */
  /* Styles for the face of the card, if any special treatment is needed beyond Tailwind */
  /* e.g., box-shadow: inset 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); */
/* } */

/* Ensure 3D transform classes are available if not in Tailwind/global index.css */
/*
.perspective {
  perspective: 1000px;
}

.preserve-3d {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.backface-hidden {
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
}
*/

/* If you decide on more complex CSS-driven reveal/glow animations, they would go here. */
/* For now, keeping it minimal as Framer Motion is powerful. */
